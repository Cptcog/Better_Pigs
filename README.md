--			Datapack Created by Cptcog.					
--		reverse engineered from several datapacks, notably:			
--		'Survivors Elegy' by Siscu						
--		'copper armor and tools' by Robo_17					
--		'sp_gear' by System Plasma						
--		**not all packs were used deliberately, just referenced, 		
--		somewhat copied, modified, and made to work. But Survivors Elegy 	
--		was ripped off from a tiny bit and I noted it in the file location.

DATAPACK ADDS:

1)Pigs now breed anywhere between at least one piglet that we're used to and up to four at once!

2)Pigs drop more porkchops, and also now drop a **unique** item called tallow!

3)Tallow can be used in any recipe that calls for charcoal, including any other datapack recipes
you might have added (okay okay, it's charcoal reskinned, I know, I know).

3.5) If a pig is killed with fire, the 'tallow' will be burned up and the pig won't drop it. :(

4)You can cook either raw porkchops or cooked porkchops in a blast furnace (not smelter!) to make charcoal! (If you know how to add NBT data to smelting recipes and would like to help, please  shoot me a message at [comradecog@gmail.com],
I couldn't figure out how to apply the tallow texture and name to smelted items.)

Be sure to install both the resource pack and the datapack in order to get the tallow item! Thanks for adding on this pack, it was my attempt to make pigs worth breeding.
